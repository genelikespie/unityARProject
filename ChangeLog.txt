Merged with Jason_Testing_Assert
Merged with testing (Kainan's test cases)
    + Test cases is under Assets/Editor/MyTests.cs

Added Test Cases
    + All tests run as coroutines, therefore, the automated unit test checker may return false positives
    + Test failures will print to the console instead!!
    + To run tests, open up Unit Test Tools->Unit Test runner
        + Run the game (click the play button)
        + Right Click MyTests->RunTest, and run the test (game must be running)
    
Changed folder arrangement
    + ALL GameStates are now under Assets/Scripts/GameStates
    + Timer is now under Assets/Scripts/GameClasses
    + Vuforia scripts Assets/originally under Scripts is now under Scripts/VuforiaScripts
